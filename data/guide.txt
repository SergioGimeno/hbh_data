Guide to the "data" folder:
	"HBH" subfolder:
		The HBH folder contains seven subfolders, each one labelled with a roman numeral (corresponding with the nomenclature employed in Table 1 of the draft.)
		Each model folder contains two subfolders ("Results" and "Results_2")
			"Results" contain a subfolder named "comp_values" that contains a collection of subfolders. Named as the corresponding for different values of the decimal logarithm of the magnetization parameter (if the name begins with an "_" it means the following number has a minus sign)
			Each subfolder has files with the following information (all files are labelled accordingly):
				- Radial profiles (for the "r" coordinate) of the rest-mass density "\rho", the pressure "p", the magnetic pressure "p_m" and the total pressure "p_t = p + p_m".
				- 2D density plot of the rest-mass density using the standard radial coordinate "r".
				- The same radial profile and 2D density plot, but using the perimeteral coordinate "R = e^(F_2) r".
				- If the name of the file ends in "_r_c" or "_r_h" means that the radial coordinate has been normalized to the radius of the disk center or the radius of the horizon, respectively.
				- The radial profile of the potential distribution "W".
				- 3 data files:
					- "intrinsic_formatted_output_data.dat" contains basically the same information as the Table 1 and 2 of the draft. (all labelled accordingly)
					- "physical_formatted_output_data.dat" contains the information of the disk (angular momentum, magnetization parameter, characteristic radii...) and also the rest-mass density, specific enthalpy, specific internal energy, pressure, magnetic pressure and total pressure values at the center of the disk, at their respective maximum and the location of said maximum.
					- "perimeteral_physical_formatted_output_data.dat" contains almost the same information as the previous file, but all the radii are expressed in terms of the perimteral coordinate "R".

			"Results_2" contains a subfolder named "l_b" and its structure is very similar to "Results" but it is generated by the new version of the code (adapted to the non-constant angular momentum case), but it is relevant to include this because of these new files:
				- "density_phi.pdf" A 2D density plot of the rest-mass density (up) and the scalar field profile \phi (down).
				- "matter_Total_energy_density.pdf" A 2D density plot of the total energy density of the torus (-T^t_t + T^i_i)
				- "matter_Total_angular_momentum_density.dat" A 2D plot of the total angular momentum density of the torus -T^t_\phi
				- "total_densities.pdf" A 2D density plot of the total energy density of the torus (-T^t_t + T^i_i) (up) and the total energy density of the scalar field (-T^t_t + T^i_i)_SF (down)
				All of the above with their respective perimeteral coordinate versions.
				Also, two new data files:
					- "field_total_densities_formatted_output_data.dat" contains the maximum value of the total energy density of the scalar field (-T^t_t + T^i_i)_SF and its radial location in both regular and perimeteral radial coordinates.
					- "total_densities_formatted_output_data.dat" contains the maximum value of the total energy density of the torus (-T^t_t + T^i_i) and the total angular momentum density of the torus -T^t_\phi and the location of both in regular and perimeteral coordinates.

	"KBH" subfolder:
		This subfolder contains different models of KBHs (all of them with M = 1), the models are labelled in two different ways:
			- "a_x" (with x being a number like 0, 09, 099 and so on): a KBH with spin parameter a = 0, 0.9, 0.99 and so on.
			- The rest of the models are labelled as follows: "x_ADM", "x_H" or "x_H_eq" (with x being a roman numeral). "x_ADM" refers to a KBH with a spin parameter a = J_ADM/M_ADM^2, with J_ADM y M_ADM being the ADM angular momentum and ADM mass of the HBH model x. "x_H" refers to a KBH with a spin parameter a = J_H/M_H^2, with J_H y M_H being the horizon angular momentum and horizon mass of the HBH model x. "x_H_eq" refers to a KBH with the same horizon linear velocity as the horizon linear velocity of model x.

			Each subfolder contains a "Results" subfolder with the same structure as the one described above.
